# Quick Backtest Examples

Run the pre-configured example backtests to see the wheel strategy in action.

## Instructions

1. Run the quick start examples:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sushant/python/option-wheels-backtester && uv run python main.py --quick-start
   ```

2. This will run backtests on example stocks (TSLA, HOOD, AFRM) and display comparison results.

3. Summarize the key findings:
   - Which stock performed best with the wheel strategy
   - How each stock compared to buy-and-hold
   - Total premiums collected for each

4. Offer to run a custom backtest on a stock of the user's choice using the /backtest command.
